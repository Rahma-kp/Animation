    name: "Forty rules of love",
    description: '''Every book has a soul and it chooses you when it’s the right time for you to read it.

This is not my typical review because there are simply no words to describe this book. Reading this was an experience where I saw love and divinity merging into my being.

My attraction to this book was huge but strangely every time I picked the book, I wasn’t sure if the book will live up to my expectations (which were very high). I had read so many reviews and was recommended this book by many people. Now when I think of it, I realise that what I really felt was that I am not evolved enough to understand a book on ‘love’ and this book can reveal my imperfections to me.

I had a non-stop whirling feeling throughout this book. For many days and nights, I was in a trance-like state. Initially I was worried that this stage is temporary and what will happen after it is gone. And then the next troublesome thought – “Will I ever be the same person again”?

And then I read this rule ‘A sufi is thankful not only for what he has been given but also for all that has been denied.’ Everything fall in place after that.

Forty rules is a story of a middle aged women Ella who reads a manuscript about the thirteenth-century Sufi poet Rumi and Shams of Tabriz and his forty rules of life and love. However, Ella had no idea how this manuscript and her interaction with the author is going to bring enormous shifts in her life.

The books switches between the adventures of current times ‘Ella & her life’ and the 13th century ‘Rumi & Shams’. Shams is on a journey where he is looking for a partner who can understand his life lessons and pour them into poetry that can be consumed by the whole world. Rumi is a philosopher who is well known for his philosophy but is not a poet. The story is about the journey of Shams and his definitions of love which includes every being on the planet.''',

    description: '''
Vaikom Muhammed Basheer is imprisoned on charges of sedition. He is unlike the other prisoners, very inquisitive and armed with sardonic wit. Everyone takes a liking to him and even turns to him in times of distress. He strikes up a friendship with the Warden(Thilakan) and an enthusiastic jailor (Sreenath). Due to his unique charisma and popularity as an author, he is afforded privileges the other prisoners don't have. His written works are greatly appreciated by the policemen, who supply him papers to finish his work. One day, Basheer is informed that he will be released soon as all political prisoners are pardoned. But unexpectedly, Basheer's name was missing from the list. His enthusiasm and happiness takes a hit and he becomes filled with uneasiness and worry. Due to the eerie solitude of the prison complex, Basheer starts to get depressed, but the other inmates try to encourage him to accompany them in making a vegetable garden in front of the neighbouring women's prison compound.''',
